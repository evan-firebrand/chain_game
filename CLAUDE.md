# Chain Game — Agent Orientation

**Read this file at the start of every session. It is the source of truth for how this project works.**

---

## Project in One Sentence

Chain Game is a browser-based 2D number-merging puzzle game with a path-chain mechanic; the design is complete and the engineering team is now building it in phases, starting with the pure game-logic kernel.

**Current phase:** Phase 3 (Tuning Console) — kernel and playable v1 are complete, Tuning Console is next.

---

## The Prime Directive

> **All game logic lives in `src/game-kernel/` and nowhere else.**

Chain validation, chain resolution, Rule D k=2 math, gravity, spawn tile selection, retirement trigger detection, loss condition detection — every rule of the game is implemented as a pure function inside `game-kernel`. Any pull request that computes game logic outside `game-kernel` is automatically rejected, no exceptions.

## Module Dependency Rules (enforced by CI)

```
sim-harness ──→ game-kernel ←── game-session ←── ui
                                              ←── tuning-console
```

**DO:**
- `game-session` imports from `game-kernel`
- `ui` imports from `game-session`
- `tuning-console` imports from `game-session`
- `sim-harness` imports from `game-kernel`

**DO NOT:**
- `game-kernel` imports from anywhere in `src/` — it is self-contained
- `ui` imports from `game-kernel` directly — always go through `game-session`
- `sim-harness` imports from `game-session` or `ui`
- Tests cross module boundaries (each test file imports only from its own module)

CI runs a dependency boundary check on every push. Violations are build failures.

## What Requires Evan's Approval (do not proceed without it)

1. Any edit to files in top-level `docs/` (the 7 design docs)
2. Any change to `game-kernel/index.ts` public API
3. Adding a Tier 1 parameter to the Tuning Console
4. Any merge to `main`
5. Any new Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
6. The sim harness output schema (`SIM_HARNESS_SCHEMA.md`)
7. Any new dependency in `package.json`

---

## Design Gap Protocol

When you hit an ambiguity not covered by the spec:

1. **Stop. Do not invent a resolution and proceed.**
2. File a GitHub issue labeled `design-question` with: file/line location, the ambiguity, 2-3 options with tradeoffs.
3. If blocked and Evan is unavailable: implement the most conservative option (closest to what the spec already says) and add a `// TODO(design-question: #NNN)` comment.
4. When Evan answers: update the code, file an ADR if the decision affects module boundaries or APIs.

**All Phase 1 design gaps are resolved.** No open questions remain before kernel implementation.

## Current Phase and Gate Status

**Phase 0 — Project Foundation** ✅ COMPLETE

**Phase 1 — game-kernel** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-28)
- All T1-T8b test vectors pass
- ≥93% line/100% function coverage on `src/game-kernel/`
- Property tests: valid chain always returns power-of-2
- Kernel source confirmed by Evan
- Zero imports outside `src/game-kernel/`

**Phase 2 — Playable v1** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-04-28)
- UAT passed by Evan
- Chain start/extension/resolution match spec
- Gravity and L-1 spawn verified
- Game-over detection and restart work
- Zero game logic in UI layer (CI boundary check passes)

**Phase 3 — Tuning Console** 🟢 IN PROGRESS (branch `feat/phase3-tuning-console`)

Gate criteria (last box waits on Evan UAT):
- [x] All Tier 1 parameters exposed (k, spawn weights per tier)
- [x] Changing k mid-game produces correct results on next chain (verified by `tests/game-session/session-update-config.test.ts`)
- [x] Config exportable as JSON (`src/tuning-console/config-export.ts` + 17 tests)
- [ ] Evan uses it in a real play session

Phase 3 also delivered:
- `docs/engineering/PARAMETER_TIERS.md` (Evan approval pending)
- ADR 0002 — `GameSession.updateConfig` Tier 1/2 contract (Evan approval pending)
- Backfilled `tests/game-session/` Phase 2 deferred suite (18 tests, 100% coverage)

See `docs/engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md` for full phase sequence.

|---|---|---|---|
| 0000 | Tech Stack | Accepted | 2026-04-28 |

## Code Rules (summary — full detail in `docs/engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

- TypeScript `strict: true`. No `any`. All exported functions have explicit return types.
- `game-kernel` functions are pure: no side effects, no `Math.random()`, no `Date.now()`, no `console.log()`. All randomness via seeded PRNG passed in config.
- `GameState` is an immutable value object. Functions return new state; they never mutate.
- Comments only when WHY is non-obvious. Never explain what the code does.
- Commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — types: `feat fix test docs refactor arch` — scopes: `kernel session ui console harness tests docs ci`
